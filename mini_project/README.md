GENERATION MINI PROJECT

the project has been completed over the span of 6 weeks. it has been done with a certain client and criteria in mind. the client is a cafe owner for whom i have created a food business management system.

the system i've created allows them to manage their food menu, couriers and orders placed by customers. 

important factors i accounted for include data persistence, testing and usability. these enabled me to meet the client brief as i included the key features the client was looking for- including other features such as invalid input handling. 

if i had more time, i would include options to return to the previous menus after an action is executed by the user. I would have also implemented code to allow the user to input multiple items which the customer has ordered rather than having to do one order at a time. additionally, i would have made my input checks more rigorous. i also would've liked to write tests for my sql querying functions.

I enjoyed implementing the testing i managed to figure out as it was new and interesting to work around.
