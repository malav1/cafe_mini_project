GENERATION MINI PROJECT

the project has been completed over the span of 6 weeks. it has been done with a certain client and criteria in mind. the client is a cafe owner for whom i have created a food business management system.

the system i've created allows them to manage their food menu, couriers and orders placed by customers. 

important factors i accounted for include data persistence, testing and usability. these enabled me to meet the client brief as i included the key features the client was looking for- including other features such as invalid input handling. 

if i had more time, i would include options to return to the previous menus after an action is executed by the user. This would be instead of only giving the user the option to return to the initial welcome menu. 

I enjoyed implementing testing as it was new and interesting to work around.
